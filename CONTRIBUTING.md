## 3. Development Setup  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zyoruk/algorithms-ui.git
cd algorithms-ui
npm install            # or yarn / pnpm
npm run dev
```

## 4. Branching & Pull Requests  
1. Fork the repo and create a branch:  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature

## 5. Testing  
- Add or update unit tests in the `src/app/algorithms` folder.  
- Run `npm test` (or your preferred test command) before submitting.

## 6. Code Style
