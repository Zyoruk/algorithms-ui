# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in **algorithms‑ui** a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language  
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences  
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism  
- Focusing on what is best for the community  

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination in any form  
- Violence, threats, or violent language directed against anyone  
- Sexual language or imagery in public spaces  
- Personal insults, derogatory comments, or hate speech  
- Publishing other people’s private information  

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that violates this Code of Conduct.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, please report it by emailing  
**conduct@algorithms-ui.org**. All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and will remain confidential.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be referred to community leaders who will determine what action is appropriate.
